Contributing to `sbpy`
======================

If you are interested in contributing to `sbpy`, you can do that
through testing existing code (somewhat easy), contributing Python
code (somewhat hard), or simply by letting us know what you think. We
are also interested in code donations: if you have code written in
Python or a different programming language and you think this code
might be useful to others, please let us know.

We would prefer any communication with the development team to go
through the `github issue system
<https://guides.github.com/features/issues/>`_. This way, all
communications are centralized in one place and accessible to
everyone. Another way to communicate in a less official way (if you
don't think your question or suggestion is worth being remembered in
the far future) is the `sbpy slack channel <http://sbpy.slack.com>`_
(requires sign-in).



Testing
-------

We are looking for volunteers to test `sbpy` functionality. In order
to make this task worthwhile for you, we only ask you to test routines
that are stable and which you can already use for your research. We
will indicate which functions are ready to be tested on this dedicated
:doc:`status`. Keep in mind that there might be issues, so feel
free to compare the function results with your own results. If you
find a problem, please issue an issue report on the github page.

Coding
------

If you would like to implement (or modify) some functionality
yourself, you are welcome to do so. Please check the wiki and the
documentation if such functionality already exists or is
planned. Before working on the code, please issue an issue report,
explaining your contribution and how it would fit into existing `sbpy`
functionality - please clearly state if existing functionality would
have to be modified. Once your contribution report has been accepted,
please fork the `sbpy` repository and work on that code. Once you are
done, please issue a pull request, linking to your original issue
report. Please follow the `astropy code of conduct`_.
